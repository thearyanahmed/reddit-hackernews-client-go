Salam, this is a project, with a single purpose and that is to understand data parallelism, golang's channels and goroutines. 

It was a fun project, you can run the project by simply cloning and changing the `geddit.NewLoginSession` credentials for reddit. You can also use oAuthLogin.
And the search option, it searchs among the data it has already fetched, not in clients ( reddit or hn ). 

And, every 20 seconds, you'll get new data that is added to the bottom.
